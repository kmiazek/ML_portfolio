# Description
In this repository, I have compiled a range of machine learning projects that demonstrate my understanding of various algorithms, techniques, and applications. 
Each project is in it's own notebook, with the project's purpose, methodology, and results.

# Projects
Here is a list of the projects included in this portfolio:

* Predicting diabetes
* Predicting credit card fraud


Feel free to explore each project folder to learn more about the specific problem, dataset, and implementation details. I have also provided any necessary datasets and code snippets to replicate and run the projects.
